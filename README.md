# Context

This repo is a collection of files related to the Omnifood coding challenges. This challenge is part of Jonas Schmedtmann's [Introductory HTML and CSS Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3). I do not own the design - me recreating it is part of the course linked above. That being said, all code written is my own.

Given that the course is related to HTML and intermediate CSS, this is also what the design is centered around. No JavaScript is included at all.

Finally, this repo contains 2 folders. The first folder, called 'Starter Files' contains the starting files, such as images and some basic starting code. The second folder, named 'My Code', contains my version of the final product.

# About Omnifood

Omnifood is a fictional startup. They use AI to create and deliver custom meal plans. For the launch of their product, they need a new, modern website which looks professional and instills trust in potential customers.

We were hired to build their website using HTML and CSS. They supplied the content which needs to be added to the website.
